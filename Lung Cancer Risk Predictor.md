Lung Cancer Risk Predictor

This project is basic implementation of lung cancer prediction based in general lifestyle factors. User will provide information about their age, smoking history, packs of cigarettes consumed per day and alcohol consumption. We have trained ml model on Random Forest Classifier to predict whether the user is at hight or low risk of developing lung cancer. 

Overview
This project is property of BiomarkIQ.
This project represents a simplified version of our work. It excludes biomarker features and instead focuses on generalize inputs to demonstrate the potential of predictive analytics.
Note: The original project is significantly more complex and leverages sophisticated biomarker data that cannot be shared publicly due to confidentiality. This app showcases the basic methodology and functionality.

How to run 
Make sure all the code, ml model is in same dictory

Use this in command prompet
streamlit run health_risk_predictor.py

The app will open at http://localhost:8501. Provide the required inputs to predict your lung cancer risk.
